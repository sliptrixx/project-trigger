# Tutorial Intro
Hi, and thanks for checking out Project Trigger. This tutorial will walk you through the basics of building a simple 2D shooter game in Unity. Although this tutorial is written for Unity, the concepts are applicable to any game engine. The tutorial uses "space" assets from [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/), so is themed as a space shooter. However, feel free to experiment with custom assets and themes.
